# Tempus: A Pioneer in AI-Enabled Precision Medicine

## Overview and Origin
Tempus was founded by Groupon co-founder and CEO Eric Lefkofsky in August of 2015 after his wife was diagnosed with Breast Cancer. This personal experience led him to explore the use of AI technology to help progress oncological knowledge and develop platforms for patient-specific diagnostics and treatments. Over the course of eight years, Tempus has received around $1.3 billion in funding, mostly through mutually beneficial partnerships with Pfizer, AstraZeneca, and the U.K. biopharma company GSK.

## Business Activities
Tempus’s platform was originally built for oncology, however, they have since expanded their platform uses to neuropsychiatry, cardiology, infectious disease, and radiology. Their customers are providers looking for patient-specific treatment options, as well as researchers and scientists looking to gain critical insights across different types of medicine. With the help of AI, clinical data, and Tempus platforms, these users can help find common diagnoses, gene profiles, and treatments to better their understanding and patient care.

A major solution that Tempus offers is its strategic partnerships with global healthcare powerhouses such as Pfizer and AstraZeneca, as well as other healthcare institutions and pharmaceutical companies. By partnering with these massive institutions, they have access to an incredible amount of data to help provide their research and treatment solutions in the medical field. 

### Their AI technologies include:<br />
* The Hub: A test and results platform that can be used on desktop or mobile, allowing providers to order, receive, and manage all of their patients' needs with ease. This platform uses AI smart reporting via clinical and molecular data from MSK OncoKB and NCCN Guidelines® to help determine treatment options for patients. <br />
* One: A clinical assistant that supplies patient insights to providers. By using AI, providers are now enabled to filter between alterations, genes, or diagnoses to gain additional insights and assist with patient treatment decisions. This application also keeps up with the latest clinical trials, filtered by patient specific enrollment criteria to support these treatment decisions.<br />
* Now: A suite of applications within electronic health records that uses advanced analytics and clinical research/trials with discrete genomic data and previous test results. 
* Lens: A platform used to empower researchers and scientists with Tempus data. Using their AI assistant and R and Jupyter-enabled Lens Workspaces, researchers can find clinical groups of interest to gain critical insights with Tempus data.<br />
* Assays: A genetic profiling service, using data from a gene DNA sequencing panel, RNA sequencing panel, ctDNA sequencing panel, gene panel for hereditary cancers, and a whole exome gene DNA sequencing panel. <br />
* Algos: A platform using algorithmic testing options to gain insights across multiple cancer types. 

Tempus also recently acquired the company Arterys, an AI company that specializes in medical imaging AI platforms. Arterys “built out a handful of tools that use deep learning and other forms of AI to analyze a range of imaging data, including lung CT scans, chest X-rays and both brain and heart MRIs.” (Landi, 2023). This acquisition enables Tempus to provide a brand new platform to their providers and scientists to help with patient care optimization.

## Landscape 
Tempus is in the medical field with the hopes of using data and AI to increase knowledge and better determine diagnoses and treatment for patients across the spectrum of medical needs. 

### Other major companies in this field include:<br />
* DeepMind: Uses algorithms and deep learning models for medical imaging analysis, predictive diagnostics, and patient care optimization<br />
* Markovate: A software company that uses AI-driven systems for predictive diagnostics and patient care, among other solutions in vastly different fields<br />
* Ezra: An AI healthcare company that specializes in early cancer detection<br />
* Biofourmis: A company that utilizes wearable devices and AI for patient monitoring
* Caption Health: A company that uses AI for early disease identification

### Some innovations in AI healthcare over the last decade include: 
Misdiagnosis of illness: “In 2015, misdiagnosing illness and medical error accounted for 10% of all US deaths. AI has been proven to predict and diagnose disease at a faster rate than most medical professionals.” (Gordon, 2021). “In the setting of a challenge competition, some deep learning algorithms achieved better diagnostic performance than a panel of 11 pathologists participating in a simulation exercise designed to mimic routine pathology workflow; algorith performance was comparable with an expert pathologist interpreting whole-slide images without time constraints.” (Bejnordi, Veta, van Diest, 2017).

In 2017, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center used AI to “diagnose deadly blood diseases to predict risks earlier than other methods. Doctors are using AI-enhanced microscopes to scan for harmful bacterias (like E. coli and staphylococcus) in blood samples at a faster rate than is possible using manual scanning. The AI machines learn how to identify and predict harmful bacteria in blood with 95% accuracy.” (Gordon, 2021).

## Results 
Tempus has been involved with numerous success stories throughout its short existence. By partnering with large scale healthcare organizations, they are able to share relevant data across these institutions to advance cancer testing and health trials.

Tempus (2024), Noted in the Tempus Press Releases that in March 2024:<br />
> “Tempus announced a generous data contribution of de-identified tumor profiles with limited   associated clinical information from more than 3,000 cancer diagnoses to the National Cancer Institute (NCI)... …This is a first of its kind contribution to NCI’s planned Data Enclave and will support the NCI’s mission of advocating cancer research by learning from each individual with cancer.”

Tempus (2024), Noted in the Tempus Press Releases that in January 2024:<br /> 
> “Tempus announced the addition of a novel MRD assay, xM MRD (formerly xM), to its comprehensive testing solutions. The tumor-naive plasma based test is available for research use only to detect circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in the blood of patients with early CRC after surgery.”

These advancements in data and medical technology will be used at the forefront for patient diagnoses and treatment, and are only a few successful implementations that Tempus has offered since the beginning of 2024.

## Recommendations 
A lot of similar companies - either direct competitors, or specialized companies, use their data and platforms to utilize and monitor medical devices. This would be a market that Tempus has not touched yet within the large realm of medicine that Tempus is hoping to change. By already adding cardiology to the list of issues they want to conquer, as well as their ever growing interest in other medical fields, medical devices should be the next step in terms of data they should look to empower.<br /> 
By creating a platform that chooses the right medical devices, as well as monitors results, they can offer their AI-driven platforms to benefit another field in medicine. With the strategic partnerships and platforms they already have in place, they could potentially take over this field. This would also give them a considerable amount of new customers, as these are common necessities throughout every community.
